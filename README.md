## [Enhancement 1](https://github.com/NoahSmith10/NoahSmith10.github.io/tree/main/Enhancement%20One/SlideShow)

### Narrative for Enhancement 1

The artifact is a slide show that was originally created for CS 250. It shows the “Top 5 Resort Destinations” and can be navigated by pressing the previous button and next button. It displays a picture of the resort, the title of it, and a short description of the resort.

I selected this artifact as it was written in Java and had a simple GUI. I thought that converting it to a web application in Typescript, CSS, and HTML would be a great example of my skills as a full-stack developer and my ability to convert between languages. Additionally, I would also have to copy the visuals from the JSwing library in CSS and HTML and this would be a demonstration of my skills recreating UI elements.

I have met the course outcomes I planned to meet with this enhancement as my commenting in the code and associated written works show my ability to communicate with diverse audiences to support decision making. I also have shown my ability to use tools and skills to create value and accomplish goals.

As I was creating and improving this artifact, I learned that there are many different types of tools that can be used to aid development. A build tool I found that was helpful to initialize the project was Vite. In the past, I have used Webpack and Babel to build projects, but I learned about Vite and found that it is much better to use. This field has constant improvements, and a professional should always be ready to learn new tools. A challenge I faced is applying the CSS styles to recreate the UI of the slide show. It took trial and error to make sure that the styles had the wanted effect on the UI.
